# IncreasingReliability_GxAge
This code was used in Giangrande et al. (2025, preprint): Developmental Increases in the Reliability of Cognitive Assessment Bias G x Age Estimates (https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/udbjr_v2).

This study examined whether controlling for developmental increases in the reliability of cognitive assessment biased estimates of G x Age interaction (also known as the _Wilson Effect_) in the Louisville Twin Study. We developed a series of continuous time dynamic models using the continuous time structural equation modeling (_ctsem_) software. For more on _ctsem_, see https://github.com/cdriveraus/ctsem.

-increasingReliabilityScript_forGithub_6.26.25.R: Fit series of continuous time dynamic models that vary in extent to which they controll for developmental reliability changes. Plot twin correlations for cognitive ability across age.
